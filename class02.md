### JQUERY
is a js file that you include in your web pages ,it let us find element using CSS style selectors and then do something with the element using jquery methods .
**why we use jquery?**
jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler. 
* jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows us to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than we would need to write with plain JavaScript. 

* a matched set or jquery selection :when we select one or more elements a jquery object is returned .
* UPDATING ELEMENTS :When the • htm 1 () and . text () methods are used as setters (to update content) they will replace the content of each element in the matched set (along with any content and child elements). 
* Inserting new elements involves two steps: 
1. Create the new elements in a jQuery object
2. Use a method to insert the content into the page
* EVENT METHODS :The • on () method is used to handle all events. Behind the scene.
* WHERE TO PLACE YOUR SCRIPTS The position of script elements can affect how quickly a web page seems to load.
