### Javascript Templating
- Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. 
* The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

#### Mustache
- Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code â€” anything.
*  It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
#### Flexbox
- The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
- display :This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. 
- flex-direction :This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container
- flex-basis :This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.)
- justify-content :This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.
