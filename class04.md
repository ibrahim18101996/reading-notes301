#### GRID
* When grid-column-start is used alone, the grid item by default will span exactly one column. However, you can extend the item across multiple columns by adding the grid-column-end property.

- Grid gives us control over how wide or narrow each of the ‘grid cells’ get.

- This allows us to maintain a sensible aspect ratio to their height. 

* The grid-template-columns property defines the number of columns in our grid layout, and it can define the width of each column.
- The ‘Holy Grail’ layout describes a page with a header and footer that stick at the top and bottom of the window respectively, and a content section that is split into two sidebars and the main content sits between them.

* Grouping and capturing — ():This operator is very useful when we need to extract information from strings or data using your preferred programming language.
